    <h1>Noteful E-Learning Journey</h1>

    <p>Despite being a foundation for music, music theory is often viewed as boring or abstract, especially amongst younger audiences. That‚Äôs where Noteful comes in: a startup aiming to make music theory fun, free, and accessible. In this project, my team and I tackle the redesign of Noteful's product experience and interface for an engaging, long-term learning journey through gamification.</p>

            <h2>Design a new dashboard with engaging features that allow students to track their learning progress.</h2>

            <p>For my senior HCI capstone project, my team worked with Noteful, a e-learning startup that teaches music theory.</p>

            <p class="top-20">When we first got onboarded to this project, our client originally requested for a revamp of their beta student dashboard to get ready for their offical launch, working mostly on interface improvements that would appeal to their audience of young kids.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Students learn music theory in conjunction to something broader, like playing the piano, but unlike that, music theory comes off as monotonous. Meanwhile, traditional worksheets and music theory apps aren't suitable for young learners, and what they want is to learn alongside friends and have fun while they're at it.</p>

            <p>During design, we naturally kicked off with revamping the home page, the central hub for Noteful's learning experience. The original one presents lessons through notes, setting them up so it reflects the curriculum that they‚Äôve established.</p>
