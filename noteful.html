    <h1>Noteful E-Learning Journey</h1>

    <p>Despite being a foundation for music, music theory is often viewed as boring or abstract, especially amongst younger audiences. That‚Äôs where Noteful comes in: a startup aiming to make music theory fun, free, and accessible. In this project, my team and I tackle the redesign of Noteful's product experience and interface for an engaging, long-term learning journey through gamification.</p>

            <p class="top-20">When we first got onboarded to this project, our client originally requested for a revamp of their beta student dashboard to get ready for their offical launch, working mostly on interface improvements that would appeal to their audience of young kids.</p>

            <h3>Move forward with clarity, not wait for certainty.</h3>
            <p>Design often happens in ambiguity, and sometimes, it's about just making a thoughtful decision with a clear understanding and design rationale. Time is limited and precious!</p>

            <p>Also a business decision, design is shaped by priorities and trade-offs. As I grow as a designer, I'm excited to work on this area more so I can better balance craft with impact.</p>

            <p>Sometimes solutions are presented upfront in projects, but I learned the value of stepping back, to uncover the real user problem and ensure the solution truly fits.</p>
