        <h1>Welcome :) I am Wendy Li, a product designer and Master's student studying design @ Pratt, currently based in NYC.</h1>
        <p>Curiosity has always been at the heart of my craft. Back in middle school, it meant spending countless hours tinkering in Photoshop CS5 just to see what I could create. That same sense of wonder later guided me through college, where I explored diverse fields, from business, psychology, to computer science, before discovering my true passion in human-computer interaction. Each detour added new layers to how I think and create, shaping me into the designer I am today.</p>

        <p class="top-20">I am someone who thrives on learning, connecting ideas across disciplines, and pushing the boundaries of what design can make possible for communities. Now, as I finish my master’s degree, I’m continuing to deepen both my technical and creative practice. To me, design is more than problem-solving: it’s a way to stay endlessly curious about people, technology, and the world around us, and I excited to see where that curiosity leads me next in my journey as a product designer!</p>

        <h2>I ask questions</h2>
        <p>I always make sure I understand the product, user behavior, and core problems. I dig into context, reach out to collaborators, and question things that don’t add up.</p>

        <h2>I connect the dots</h2>
        <p>I bring energy to conversations and bridge perspectives, weaving together viewpoints into solutions that feel bigger than what any one person could create alone.</p>
